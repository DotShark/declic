Anonymous addiction screening and resource navigation platform for students.

## 🎯 Overview

Declic is a web and mobile platform designed to help students identify risky behaviors related to addictions and connect them with appropriate support resources in under 5 minutes.

The platform addresses a critical gap: while addiction support services exist, students often don't know they need help, don't know where to find it, or feel too stigmatized to seek it out.
